\section{Selected Projects}
\cvitem{2020 -- Present}{\textbf{drf-psq:} An extension for Django REST framework that gives support for having method-based permission$\_$class, serialize$\_$class, and queryset. Not released yet.}

\cvitem{2019 -- Present}{\textbf{AnyTrading:} A collection of \href{https://gym.openai.com}{\color{blue}{OpenAI Gym}} environments for reinforcement learning-based trading algorithms with a great focus on simplicity, flexibility, and comprehensiveness. \href{https://github.com/AminHP/gym-anytrading}{\color{blue}{Github link}}.}

\cvitem{2018 -- Present}{\textbf{Musical Chord Detection:} An application that detects \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_note}{\color{blue}{musical notes}} in a musical signal (created by Piano, Guitar, etc). It's a very difficult problem and still isn't solved completely. Typically there exist 108 different notes and detecting a single note is kind of simple but the problem shows up when some notes are played simultaneously (chords). Imagine if someone plays 10 Piano notes with his 10 fingers, then there could be almost $100^{10}$ possible different chords. Solving this problem using basic ANN algorithms is not actually possible.}

\cvitem{2017 -- Present}{\textbf{Chillin:} A tool for creating game AI competitions. It consists of multiple components, including a \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-PyServer}{\color{blue}{server framework}} written in Python, four components written in \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-PyClient}{\color{blue}{Python}}, \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-CSharpClient}{\color{blue}{C\#}}, \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-CppClient}{\color{blue}{C++}}, and \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-JavaClient}{\color{blue}{Java}}. Also, Chillin came up with a \href{https://github.com/koala-team/Chillin-Monitor-2}{\color{blue}{3D monitor}} to spectate the games and watch what happens in the field. \newline \href{https://2017.chillinwars.ir}{\color{blue}{ChillinWars 2017}}, \href{https://2019.chillinwars.ir}{\color{blue}{ChillinWars 2019}}, and \href{https://2020.chillinwars.ir}{\color{blue}{ChillinWars 2020}} utilized this tool to create games for their competitions. Some examples can be found \href{https://github.com/Chillin-Examples}{\color{blue}{here}}.}

\cvitem{2017 -- Present}{\textbf{Koala Serializer:} A tool similar to \href{https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers}{\color{blue}{Google Protobuf}} that enables the Chillin framework to be much more automated and simpler. \href{https://github.com/koala-team/serializer}{\color{blue}{Github link}}.}

\cvitem{2019}{\textbf{InstaRobot:} An \href{https://cafebazaar.ir/app/com.instagram.instarobot/?l=en}{\color{blue}{Android application}} that provides some tools for Instagram users.}

\cvitem{2018}{\textbf{Facial Expression Recognition (Bachelor Final Project):} A new solution for solving the famous Facial Expression Recognition problem using MLP and feature extraction. It detects 8 emotions (anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, surprise) with an average accuracy of 97\% on the CK+ dataset.  \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/i6pkzhfzp8jkpaz/FinalProjectArticle_FER.pdf?dl=0}{\color{blue}{Article link}}.}

\cvitem{Spring 2017}{\textbf{Inverted Pendulum:} A system that simulates the famous \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum}{\color{blue}{Inverted Pendulum}} problem written in Python. Also, a fuzzy controller is implemented that tries to keep the pendulum inverted in the environment. It was a project for the Computational Intelligence course. \href{https://github.com/AminHP/fuzzy_inverted_pendulum}{\color{blue}{Github link}}.}

\cvitem{Fall 2016}{\textbf{Pourse:} A web service and application that provides some information about Stocks for Software Engineering course project. The project's backend was implemented using Erlang and Python programming languages and the Riak database.  \href{https://gitlab.com/Pourse/Server}{\color{blue}{Gitlab link}}.}

\cvitem{2015 -- 2017}{\textbf{IJust:} An open-source online ACM judge. \href{https://github.com/koala-team/ijust_server}{\color{blue}{Github link}}, \href{https://ijust.ir}{\color{blue}{ijust.ir}}.}

\cvitem{Spring 2015}{\textbf{OCR Site:} A simple website that provides single character OCR written in Python for Advanced Programming course project. The recognizer was an MLP and all parts of it were implemented from scratch (including ANN trainer).  \href{https://github.com/AminHP/OCR-Site}{\color{blue}{Github link}}.}

\cvitem{Fall 2014}{\textbf{PyTanks:} A multiplayer network game implemented by Python for the Basic Programming course project. Also, an AI (using Q-Learning) was implemented for tanks to help them run away from bombs. \href{https://github.com/mak-elmos/PyTanks}{\color{blue}{Github link}}.}

\cvitem{2011 -- 2013}{\textbf{Robot Path Planning:} RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation is a seniors' tournament that is a part of robotics tournaments such as IranOpen. Its goal is to write a code that manages 11 \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nao_(robot)}{\color{blue}{NAO robots}} to play soccer in a simulated environment. My job in the team was creating and implementing a new path planning algorithm for these robots. Our TDP which was sent for World Championship 2013 competitions and qualified, can be found \href{https://www.dropbox.com/s/nkwcxfojufvafgt/3d_tdp_s4m.pdf?dl=0}{\color{blue}{here}}.  \href{https://gitlab.com/4/4d-simulation}{\color{blue}{Gitlab link}}.}
